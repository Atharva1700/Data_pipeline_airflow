# DATA PIPELINE WITH AIRFLOW

A robust and modular data pipeline built using Apache Airflow. This project demonstrates how to orchestrate ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes using DAGs, enabling automated and scheduled data workflows with monitoring and logging features.

## Overview

This project showcases the implementation of a complete data pipeline using Apache Airflow. It is designed to extract data from a source, perform transformations, and load the processed data into a destination system (such as a database or a file system). The pipeline is built as a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) with tasks scheduled and executed in a defined sequence.

The project highlights concepts such as task dependency, scheduling, retry logic, logging, and modular DAG design â€” all essential for production-ready data pipelines.

## How it Works

1. *Start Airflow*: Use Docker Compose or a virtual environment to launch the Airflow webserver and scheduler.
2. *Pipeline Structure*:
   - *Extract*: Fetch raw data from a data source (e.g., API, CSV file, database).
   - *Transform*: Clean, validate, and reformat the data as needed.
   - *Load*: Save the processed data into a target system or data warehouse.
3. *Scheduling*: DAGs are scheduled to run at defined intervals (daily, hourly, etc.) or triggered manually.
4. *Monitoring*: The Airflow UI provides real-time visualization of task status and logs.
5. *Error Handling*: Includes retry policies and failure alerts for robust pipeline execution.

## Technologies Used

- *Python*: For defining task logic and Airflow operators
- *Apache Airflow*: Core orchestration tool used for DAG scheduling and task management
- *Docker (optional)*: To containerize and run Airflow environment
- *Pandas*: For data transformation (if applicable)
- *SQL / File Systems*: For data input/output destinations

## Lessons Learned

Developing this project helped reinforce key data engineering concepts:

- *Workflow Orchestration*: Understanding Airflow DAGs, operators, and task dependencies
- *Automation*: Scheduling repeatable workflows without manual intervention
- *Monitoring & Debugging*: Using Airflow UI and logs for visibility into execution
- *Error Recovery*: Implementing retries and task-level exception handling
- *Modularity*: Structuring reusable and maintainable pipeline components
